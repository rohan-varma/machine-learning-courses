    "- Helps control overfitting by penalizing parameters according to a specific loss function that is a function of the weights. \n",
    "- Original loss function: $L = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} L_i$ \n",
    "- New, regularized loss function: $L = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} L_i  + \\lambda R(W)$ where R(W) is a function of the weights .\n",
    "- Example: L2 regularization: \n",
    "  - Penalize the weights by their L2 norm. This discourages large weights. If we have 2 sets of weights that perform the same, regularizing with l2 norm would prefer the smaller weights. \n",
    "  - **Why are smaller weights preferable? **\n",
    "    - Consider linear regression where you have 2 sets of features that differ by an extremely small amount $\\epsilon$ . So we'd have $y_1 = Wx_1 + K$ and $y_2 = W(x_ 1 \\epsilon) + K$  , so the 2 predictions would differ by $W\\epsilon$. Since these 2 feature vectors differ by only a very small amount we'd want their predictions to be close together by a model that has the ability to generalize, but if W were very large then this would not be true.\n",
    "  - L2 penalty makes classifier more likely to take into account all of the input features and place a small weight on each, instead of placing larger weights on a few specific inputs, which is achievable through L1 regularization\n",
    "- L2 regularization is equivalent to putting a gaussian prior on the W you are tying to estimate. L1 imposes a Laplacian prior.\n",
    "- L1 regularization leads to sparse weights, which is good when you want a sparse model that only activates for a few specific features. It can also thus make the classifier work more like a feature detector - when certain features are detected then the model activities, and it does not activate when other features are present (since those weights are set to 0)\n",
